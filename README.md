# teller-man
A **game engine**, a **live editor** and a **debugging environment** (IDE) for browser based text adventure games.

You can try out the IDE loaded with a sample (dumb) game at <https://gauchedroite.github.io/teller-man/index-ide.html>.

Everything is written in TypeScript and LESS.

Only npm scripts are used to build the app. No fancy webpack or gulp scripts involved.

See the [Wikki](wiki) for more docs.
